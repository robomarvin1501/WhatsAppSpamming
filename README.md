WhatsApp spammer
================

This is a project written in Rust to spam a target on WhatsApp via WhatsApp web.  
Please ensure that the browser is open on WhatsApp web, with your target's chat open.  

There are three main subsections of the program:  

1. Show screen coordinates:  
    - Continuously prints out the position of the cursor so you know where to tell it to click  
2. Spam a whole message:  
    - Sends a whole message at a time at a specified interval  
3. Spam letter by letter  
    - Sends the entire message letter by letter, as fast as possible
